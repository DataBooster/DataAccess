		<b>Project Description</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		The dbParallel DataBooster library is a high-performance extension to ADO.NET Data Provider, includes two aspects:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A slimmed down API encapsulation which simplified the most common data access operations (DbConnection -> DbCommand -> DbParameter
			-> DbDataReader) into a single class <b>DbAccess</b>, to help application with a clean DAL, avoid over-packing and redundant-copy
			of data transfer.<br />
			Please consider using this for your application development if Entity Framework can not meet your performance requirement.
		</li>
		<li>A booster for writing mass data onto database. Base on a rational utilization of database concurrency and a effective utilization
			of network bandwidth, the booster implements a transmitting mechanism like a Multiple Launch Rocket System, which </li>
	</ul>
